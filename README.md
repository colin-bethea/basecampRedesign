# Basecamp UI Redesign

A Basecamp (semi)-clone and redesign inspired by [Devwalks](https://www.devwalks.com/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-lets-build-basecamp-1/).

# Running

You will need Rails 5.1 or higher. After running `bundle install` and `rails db:migrate` in the project's root, simply run `rails s` to start the server.
